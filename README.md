# Tarot-Journal
A yearly journal for exploring the tarot

Features discussed:
  1. Calendar ability to view day and card drawn
  2. Analytics to see how often a card, suit, etc. were picked -- any way to connect this to the notes for the day as well?
  3. A journal aspect for each seperate card to write down intuitions and related art, culture, and emotions
  4. Can we include pictures of the card? Need to search for an API that has most of the deck's pictures perhaps, or include an upload feature

implement a R.E.A.D. structure:
R- Response; note your intial response to the card
E- Emotion; How does this card make me feel?
A- Action; what does the card want me to do? What are the figures in the card doing?
D- Details; symbols, color, numerology, animals

First is going to be a READ style journal for all the cards, then we can implement some calendar aspect and analytics.
