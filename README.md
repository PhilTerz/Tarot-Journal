# Tarot-Journal
A yearly journal for exploring the tarot

Features discussed:
  1. Calendar ability to view day and card drawn
  2. Analytics to see how often a card, suit, etc. were picked -- any way to connect this to the notes for the day as well?
  3. A journal aspect for each seperate card to write down intuitions and related art, culture, and emotions
  4. Can we include pictures of the card? Need to search for an API that has most of the deck's pictures perhaps, or include an upload feature
